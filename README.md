# Go Donuts
### Website: https://somunachima.github.io/threejs-donut/

## About
A Three.js app about donuts including fun animation effects and a 3D donut model (made by Â¡Jacques).

## Purpose
This aim of this project was to continue learning about Three.js but this time with an irregular shape and to use GSAP to make cool animations that causes the donut to move from side to side. I also had fun writing the information for the app as someone who really loves donuts.

## Challenges
I initially found it quite difficult to wrap my head around the use of PropTypes in React.js but it proved extremely beneficial learning this skill when resolving errors.

## Next Steps
While this was also a great opportunity for me to use Tailwind to create a simple design, I would like to add more colour and interactivity to the app. In future, I also plan to add two more models, heart and save, so that users can like and save posts to refer back to at a later date, giving them a place to store a list of anime recommendations. And to make it more fun I want to add a Spotify anime playlist to play some anime themed music!
